Does the home page create adequate interaction and a pleasing visual experience that is fitting for the client and its customers?
- on first glance it does not appear pleasing  (overall). likely too many colors.
- Additionally - it looks like its been copied nearly 100% from another learners submission

Are CSS styling and effects used effectively to create intentional engagement?
- yes. Css can be simplified quite a bit- and ideally should not be larger than in the video in the course. Good work on the hover state css.

What works well?
- generally well structured content- shows engagement - as the class repeatedly points out
- excellent metatags- especially the og: tags. Don't forget to update the title tag

What advice can you give to improve the user experience, layout and visuals of the home page?
- too many colors - as shown in my screenshot. Could be more muted.
- minor mistakes in css - (extra braces and missing values) and html - extra non-closed tag

needs to be own work, however has been graded on own merits.
Not sure how this is nearly an identical match to another learner.
