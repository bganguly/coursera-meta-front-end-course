Does the home page create adequate interaction and a pleasing visual experience that is fitting for the client and its customers?
- too many images overall
- too many hover effects (these should be used sparingly)
- use of all uppercase in links is jarring

Are CSS styling and effects used effectively to create intentional engagement?
- the css is far too complex (it will be evident in later vidoes- currently locked) that it can be simplified significantly

What works well?
- the general 'theme' of a plan based background intent is fine. But its implementation is not conducive to business purposes

What advice can you give to improve the user experience, layout and visuals of the home page?
- fix missing closing tag on 2nd img elem in html
- simplify css
- no need for hover text on every single text
- styskeet declaration goes _inside_ suitable tag
- no need for hrs
- consider correct usage of primary body elemnsts- these should just be header/nav/main/footer
