Does the home page create adequate interaction and a pleasing visual experience that is fitting for the client and its customers?
- yes.

Are CSS styling and effects used effectively to create intentional engagement?
- yes. Css can be simplified quite a bit- and ideally should not be larger than in the video in the course.

What works well?
- generally well structured content- shows engagement - as the class repeatedly points out

What advice can you give to improve the user experience, layout and visuals of the home page?
- the metatags can be provided- for seo optimisation.
- the structure can be done using either grid or flexbox. mixing them is not necessary
- the border/bar over the copyright extends just over the text 'copyright'- it ought to cover the entire right half- as in the sample shown in the class
- might be better to spell out copyright company name- rather than leave at just copyright and some single accented character

overall great work !
