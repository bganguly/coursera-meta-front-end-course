Does the home page create adequate interaction and a pleasing visual experience that is fitting for the client and its customers?
- yes- except , for the main content, the text color is white, so on the typical website nothing is visible. this shows that we are relying on the presence of a large grey or other colored ing for it to be readable.

Are CSS styling and effects used effectively to create intentional engagement?
- yes. Css can be simplified quite a bit- and ideally should not be larger than in the video in the course.
What works well?
- generally well structured content and metatags
What advice can you give to improve the user experience, layout and visuals of the home page?
- the content/text color should never be white.
- the alt on the images could be more better - for screen readers
- the incorrect usage of flex/grid for main content means it does not render okay on smaller screens- like iphone SE (use chrome console)
